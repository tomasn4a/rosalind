    "**Solution**: There are not a lot of algorithms to consider when solving this problem so after implementing the straight-forward solution using Python's 'replace' built-in method we will take the chance to explore Biopython, a popular module used by many researchers and developers worldwide for computational molecular biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, Python offers a highly optimized replace function which works perfectly for the task at hand. However, if you do not know this method and are stuck somewhere without internet, an interesting approach is to first split the original string into a list of substrings at each occurrence of the character we want to replace using 'split'. For example the string \"GATGG\" will become the list [\"CA\",\"GG\"]. Then we can simply join them with the character we want to replace using 'join' and done!"
